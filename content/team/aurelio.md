[David Aurelio](../media/img/team/aurelio.jpg)

I fell in love with the web ten years ago. Starting as an allround developer, I was focusing on frontend development during the last years and discovered my love for interface creation and UX. 

After joining uxebu in 2009, I switched to the mobile sphere and have been working with mobile devices since then. I am the one behind [TouchScroll](http://uxebu.com/blog/2010/04/27/touchscroll-a-scrolling-layer-for-webkit-mobile/), a scrolling layer with momentum for WebKit Mobile based devices, which caught quite some attention these days.
