I am hacking JavaScript at uxebu since 2010 and find it very important to split up my attention to both frontend and backend. Orly? Yarly: I recently wrote an iPhone app which sends live sensor data via node.js to browsers for i.e. WebGL vizualisations. Now that we have node and a great commmunity to boost, rich browser web apps and their server counterparts finally converge. It is a great time to do JavaScript now! I currently love hacking node, several document/KV-stores, iOS and websockets and other HTML5 APIs.
