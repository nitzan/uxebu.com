In 2000 I joined a startup which I helped to burst in the bubble :). I have been freelancing since then, interrupted by founding and failing my first startup.
All that led to a pure JavaScript company - which felt a bit scary back in 2008. In 2009 we jumped into JavaScript for mobiles, that was somehow a logical step. And now I am happy I took all those steps to help build uxebu with the two co-founders. We always wanted to focus on bleeding edge and so did we.
