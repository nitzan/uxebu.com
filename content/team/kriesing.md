I have been cruising the web universe since 2000 when I joined a startup I helped to burst in the bubble :). After working and freelancing for several other companies such as MySQL and BMW, founding and failing my first startup, time was right to focus fully on the open web.  

Co-founding uxebu, a JavaScript! company, felt a bit scary back in 2008, but together with [Tobias](/team/klipstein.html) and [Nikolai](/team/onken.html) we have been taking the logical next steps into JavaScript on mobiles. We always wanted to focus on bleeding edge and so we do now.
