JS President

[Tobias Schneider](/media/img/team/schneider.jpg)

Rocket scientiest and JavaScript fanboy since 2003, a loving dad and demanding husband. Before JavaScript became my day job as part of the uxebu team, I was freelancing as a PHP and Ruby on Rails developer.

I'm the creator of the open source Flash runtime Gordon and responsible for a bunch of other JavaScript abuses like def.js.
