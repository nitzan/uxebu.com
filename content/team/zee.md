Born at the peak of the mountains of zoom, this warrior pretty much devoted his life to the science that is ones and zeroes. Off to a rocky start, he quickly clears the road to bliss and learns a few more languages, next to Dutch and English. From high to low, he eventually ends up speaking the language of Jee'es.

On the way he listens to the wise men of the Cognitive Artificial Intelligence collective, who eventually give him the token of Bee'Scee. Not quite the highest award, it is still a much appreciated token. And even though it's quite useless in this specific field of I'net, it can still give him special insights when attacking a certain... "problem".

Special Moves
-------------

* Speaks fluient Jee'es, without the use of assistance
* Can pass on the knowledge of Jee'es to those who wish to embrace it's way of life
