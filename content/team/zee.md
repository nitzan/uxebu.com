*(Editors note: not sure what he means)*

Born at the peak of the mountains of zoom, this warrior pretty much devoted his life to the science that is ones and zeroes. Off to a rocky start, he quickly clears a road to philosophical bliss and learns a few more languages while doing so, next to Dutch and English of course. From high to low, he eventually ends up in the volatile area of I'net, speaking the language of Jee'es.

On the way he listens to the wise men of the Cognitive Artificial Intelligence collective, who eventually give him the token of Bee'Scee. While not quite the highest award, it is still a much appreciated token. And even though it's almost useless in this specific area of I'net, it can still give him special insights when attacking a certain... "problem".

Special Moves

* Speaks fluient Jee'es by just using the power of mind
* Can pass on the knowledge of Jee'es to those who wish to embrace it's way of life
