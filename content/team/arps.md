[Jens Arps](../media/img/team/arps.jpg)

I am a Dojo-Enthusiast and Front-End-Developer, and prefer Lavazza coffee over Segafredo. Before joining uxebu, I was focusing on web apps and user interfaces as a freelancer.

Nowadays, developing cross-platform applications for embedded devices is my main occupation.
My OpenSource contributions can be found in large projects like the [Dojo Toolkit](http://dojotoolkit.org) as well as small ones like [StorageJS](https://github.com/jensarps/StorageJS), though most of my time now goes into [EmbedJS](http://embedjs.org).



Special Moves
-------------

* Client Side Persistent Storage
* Dojo
* Recreating an old 3D RPG in WebGL
