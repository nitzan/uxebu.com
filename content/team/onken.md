[Nikolai Onken](../media/img/team/onken.jpg)

I have been developing web applications since 1997 and since then continuously been involved with open source projects such as the [Dojo Toolkit](http://dojotoolkit.org). 

Since 2008, mobile cross platform development has been the primary focus of my work and I am pushing the browser as platform forward through projects like [HumanAPI](http://humanapi.org). 

Being a co-founder of uxebu, I am now developing tools like [apparat.io](http://apparat.io) for developers to make mobile HTML5 development easier.
