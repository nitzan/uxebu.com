=========

This is the node/markdown based HTML generator for uxebu.com  
Content is maintained through Markdown files which map to HMTL templates.

Quickstart
----------

**1. Creating the HTML Template**

Create a index.html HTML template and put it into the src directory

```html
<doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Ohai</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        {{#block0}}
        {{!simpleBox}}
            <h1>{{title}}</h1>
            {{{content}}}
            <p><a href="{{link}}" class="alternative">{{{linkContent}}}</a></p>
        </div>
        {{/block0}}        
    </body>
</html>
```

You see that we are using the simpleBox renderer in this block which essentially means that we expect a certain type of markdown for this section.

**2. Creating the Markdown content**

Now create a Markdown file with the same name as the HTML file in the content directory (index.md)

```markdown
Welcome folks

This is a demo of our super simple Markdown to HTML converter.

After you have done this you can move on to building the site.

How to build a new site
-----------------------

**building**

```javascript
node build.js
```

**verbose mode**

```javascript
node build.js -v
```


**debugging mode**

```javascript
node build.js -d
```

**kicking of the post processor**

```javascript
node build.js -p ./path/processor.js
```

All deployable content lies in ./release

Static content
--------------

The build tool currently supports three types of static content:

1. src/static

Everything within this directory gets copied over to the release directory. Use this directory for JS, CSS and other stuff which is independent from your content

2. content/media

This is all the static content which is related to the actual content of your site. For example pictures of your team would land in here.

3. content/favicon.ico

The build script copies the favicon from the content dir to the release dir.

Content editing
---------------

All content lies in the ./content directory.
Within your Markdown document, blocks which get passed to different content handlers have to be seperated by h1 headers:

```markdown
This is block one
=================

Some text of block one

This is block two
=================

Some text of block two.
```

Make sure that you write the content as it is required by the containing box.

You can find the available Markdown to HTML blocks in:

blocks/block.js

If you want to add a custom block, simply add it do the block.js and reference it in your template using a comment such as:

{{!simpleBox}}

Template editing
----------------

Website templates are located in ./src and can use the Mustache template syntax.
To achieve mapping of markdown blocks to template blocks you have to let the build tool know that a certain Mustache block should map to a Markdown block:

```html
{{#block0}}
{{!simpleBox}}
<div class="col-6 last">
    <h2 class="h3 line business mbx">{{title}}</h2>
    {{{content}}}
    <div class="ft">
        <p><a href="{{link}}" class="alternative">{{{linkContent}}}</a></p>
    </div>
</div>
{{/block0}}
```

The block number maps directly to the position of the block in the Markdown definition (this might be confusing and prune to errors but so far we have not found a better solution)
In the example above for instance we want to use the simpleBox renderer which returns an object with a title, content, link and linkContent properties.
The corresponding Markdown content in this case looks like following:

```markdown

Mapping of Markdown and HTML templates
--------------------------------------

Per default each Markdown file in the content directory must map to a HTML template with the same base name (e.g. home.md -> home.html)
If this constrain is making life too hard you can optionally define mapping of one HTML template to several Markdown files in a directory.
To do so, adjust the mapping property of the exports object in appConfig.js

```javascript
var mapping = exports.mapping = {
    'team': '/team'
};
```

This would now result in the team.html file in the src directory to be the template for all Markdown files within the team directory in the content directory.
